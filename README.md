# Go Notes


This repository contains structured **notes** and **code snippets** to help with learning and mastering **Golang**. All topics are organized in a way that combines **theory and hands-on examples** to reinforce concepts.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main sections:  
- **`notes/`** â†’ Contains written explanations for each topic.  
- **`code-examples/`** â†’ Contains Go code snippets associated with the notes.  

Each section follows the **same numbered structure** for consistency.  

### ðŸ—‚ How Topics Are Organized  

Topics are **numbered in hundreds**, where:  
- `100.basics/` covers fundamental concepts.  
- `999.coming-soon/` future topics that might be add

Each topic contains **subtopics**, numbered in tens, for better organization.  

### ðŸ“Œ Example  

If a note is located at: `notes/100.basics/101.what-is-go.md`, a related code example will be found at: `code-examples/100.basics/101.hello_world.go`

Keep in mind that not every note needs to have a corresponding code snippet.

This repository is a work in progress, and new topics will be added over time.
