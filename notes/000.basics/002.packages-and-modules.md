# 002. Packages and Modules

---

### **Recall**

**Packages**

**Modules**

**Main function**

### **Notes**

- Packages are how Go organizes your code. Even the built-in functions provided by the [standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std) are structured as packages
    - Every Go file is bound to a package, and every Go application must have at least a main package. The main package will be used as the entry point of the application
    - Packages can be spread across multiple files, and more than one package can be used in the same application
    - To create a package, use the keyword package followed by the package name. Use the same package name across different files to split it
    - To import a package, use the keyword import followed by the name of the package or a list of packages
- Modules are the actual Go application compiled into machine code.
    - To initiate a module, use:
    
    ```bash
    go mod init module-path/module-name
    ```
    
    - To create the compiled application, use:
    
    ```bash
    go build
    ```
    
    This will search for the main package in your Go files and create the application from there
    
    - After that, imports of local packages should contain the module path, like:
    
    ```bash
    module-path/module-name/your-package
    ```
    
    - When using modules, every function you want to export must be capitalized. Just as fmt.Println, your functions should be capitalized if you want them to be used in other packages

Go is a compiled static typed language developed by Google and published as an open-source project in 2009. It becomes a popular language for offering high performance while preserving simple syntax bundled by a powerful standard library. 

Because of its features, Go has become the main choice for developing microservices, networking applications and CLI tools for both cybersecurity and DevOps.
