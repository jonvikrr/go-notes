# 005. Text Formatting

### **Recall**

**Outputting values**

**Value Formatting**

**String Formatting**

### **Notes**

- To output a value in Go, you can use the fmt.Print or fmt.Printl functions, as shown previously:

```go
bar := "bar"
fmt.Println("Foo", bar)
// Foo bar
```

- in Go, as in C, Java, and C#, you use double quotes for printing strings. Single quotes are typically used for individual characters. Another way to print text is by using backticks (`), which allow you to preserve line breaks and formatting

```go
bar := "bar"
fmt.Println(`Foo
`, bar)
//    Foo
// bar
```

- When printing floating-point numbers, it's often useful to control the number of decimal places for better readability. Go provides fmt.Printf for that purpose

```go
bar := 193.3215
fmt.Printf("Foo %v", bar)
// Foo 193.3215
```

- Similar to C, fmt.Printf uses **format specifiers** (also called *verbs*) to define how values should be displayed. The %v verb is a generic placeholder, but Go offers specific verbs for different data types

```go
bar := 193.3215
fmt.Printf("Foo %.2f", bar)
// Foo 193.32
```

- %.xf is the standard format for floating-point numbers, where x determines the number of decimal places.
- If you need to create a formatted string, you can use fmt.Sprint. This allows you to generate a formatted string and print it later, without formatting it directly in fmt.Print. The fmt package also provides variations like Sprintln and Sprintf, which work similarly to their Print counterparts but return the formatted string instead of printing it immediately

```go
value := 193.3215
bar := fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", value)
fmt.Println("Foo", bar)
// Foo 193.32
```

In Go, values are printed using the fmt.Print and fmt.Println functions. Strings are enclosed in double quotes, while single quotes are used for individual characters. Backticks can also be used to preserve line breaks and formatting. For floating-point numbers, fmt.Printf allows control over decimal places using format specifiers, such as %.2f to display two decimal places. If you need to create a formatted string without printing it immediately, you can use fmt.Sprint, fmt.Sprintf, or fmt.Sprintln, which work similarly to their Print counterparts but return the formatted string instead of displaying it directly
