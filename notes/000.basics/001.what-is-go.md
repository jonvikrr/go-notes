**What is Go**

**What Go has**

**Where Go is used**

### **Notes**

- Go is a programming language developed by Google in 2007 and made public as an open-source project in 2009
- Go is a compiled language, so to code in it youâ€™ll need its compiler
- Presents features such as:
    - Simplicity, clarity and scalability: Provides a simple syntax similar to Python, aiming to help developers to code
    - High performance and concurrency: Similar to C/C++, is useful in applications that require concurrency/multithreading
    - Batteries included: Comes with a standard library that has many core features out-of-box such as a built-in HTTP server, cryptography libraries, testing framework and so on.
    - Static typing: Ensured type safety, allowing developers to catch compiling errors faster
- Itâ€™s mostly used in areas that require performance and security such as:
    - Microservices
    - CLI Tools
    - Networking applications
    - Cybersecurity/DevOps tools

Go is a compiled static typed language developed by Google and published as an open-source project in 2009. It becomes a popular language for offering high performance while preserving simple syntax bundled by a powerful standard library. 

Because of its features, Go has become the main choice for developing microservices, networking applications and CLI tools for both cybersecurity and DevOps.
